# java-backend

A personal collection of Java backend projects for learning, experimentation, and hands-on practice.

---

##  Overview

This repository contains multiple Java backend modules ranging from JDBC demos and servlet examples to utility tools and small applications. It's designed as a practical learning workspace for building backend skills from scratch.

---

##  Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java (e.g., Java 11 or 17)  
- **APIs & Frameworks:** Servlets / JSP (in relevant modules)  
- **Database Integration:** JDBC (in modules like `demojdbc`)  
- **Development Tools:** JDK, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Build Tools:** *(If applicable—mention Maven or Gradle)*  

---

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Akhil-vk18/java-backend.git
    cd java-backend
    ```

2. **Open a module:**
   - Navigate to any folder (e.g., `demojdbc/`)
   - Open it in your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

3. **Run the code:**
   - Identify the `Main.java` (or equivalent) entry point
   - Run it as a Java application
   - For modules using a database: set up your local database and adjust connection parameters in the code

##  Future Enhancements

- Add detailed `README.md` files in each module with setup instructions, usage, and visuals  
- Standardize naming conventions and folder structures across modules  
- Integrate testing frameworks like JUnit for automated testing  
- Create shared utilities for DB configuration, logging, etc.  
- Add your upcoming **Library Management System** as a new module once it’s ready
